# ReliefSupports Platform

This is a community-driven Open Source project to support relief support activities conducted by volunteers. This project was originally created to support flood relief activities in Sri Lanka in May 2017. We are revamping the entire platform at the moment to mainly focus on supporting the economic and humanitarian crisis we are about to face in Sri Lanka.

We welcome your innovative ideas, codeing and non-coding contributions and suggestions to build a better platform.
